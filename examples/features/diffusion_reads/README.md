# Structured reads on DiffusionGemma

A discrete diffusion model denoises a whole canvas per forward pass. If the
canvas is seeded with the answer's fixed text and only the answer slots are
left as noise, one denoise step yields a calibrated distribution over each
slot. Three `extra_args` fields (`vllm_xargs` on the OpenAI server) expose
that:

| field | type | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `diffusion_seed_canvas` | `list[int]`, exactly `canvas_length` ids | replaces the random initial canvas after prefill |
| `diffusion_max_steps` | `int` | denoise steps before the canvas is emitted |
| `diffusion_read_only` | `bool` | emit the argmax canvas as soon as the cap is reached, end the request there, and return temperature-1 logprobs at every position |

`structured_server.py` is the layer that turns a question schema into those
fields. It speaks `/v1/chat/completions`: the system message is the schema,
the user message is the state JSON, and the reply content is one
distribution per question with a standard error over a few noise draws.

```bash
vllm serve google/diffusiongemma-26B-A4B-it \
    --diffusion-config '{"canvas_length": 64}' --max-logprobs 32 --enable-prefix-caching
python examples/features/diffusion_reads/structured_server.py \
    --upstream http://127.0.0.1:8000 --tokenizer google/diffusiongemma-26B-A4B-it --canvas 64
curl -s localhost:8011/v1/chat/completions -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{
  "messages": [
    {"role": "system", "content": "{\"questions\": [{\"id\": \"urgent\", \"type\": \"noul\", \"instructions\": \"Does the customer need a reply within the hour?\"}]}"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "{\"ticket\": \"Everything is down and we have a demo at noon.\"}"}
  ]}'
```

Question types: `noul` (yes/no), `choice` with `options`, `score` with
ordered `levels`. Each label must be a single token in the answer template,
which the server checks with the tokenizer before the first request.
